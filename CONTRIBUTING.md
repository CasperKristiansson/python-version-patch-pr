# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the CPython Patch PR Action! This document outlines guidelines to help you get started.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install Node.js 20.x or newer and npm 9.x or newer.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install` once the action scaffold is available.

## Workflow

- Create feature branches from `main` with a descriptive name.
- Keep commits focused and provide meaningful messages.
- Open a pull request early for feedback. Draft PRs are welcome.
- Ensure automated tests and linters pass before requesting review.

## Code Style

We will adopt TypeScript and follow the formatting enforced by Prettier and ESLint once added. Please match the existing style for any files you edit.

## Documentation

Update relevant documentation (e.g. the README) when you introduce user-facing changes or new configuration options.
